# Game Programming Techniques

Game Programming Techniques was a 2D game programming course at the University of Canberra. Students developed a Breakout game with ready templates and framework from the course organisers as tutorial work, and the final assignment was to create a game using the framework.

The folders consist of different tutorial contents (steps on building the Breakout game), the finished Breakout game and a tower defense hack-and-slash game developed by me.

Developed using C# on Visual Studio.
